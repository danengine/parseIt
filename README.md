**ANALYZE ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS AND REGEX PATTERNS, CONFIRM VALIDITY, AND REVEAL THEIR CONSTRUCTION ACCORDING TO CONTEXT-FREE GRAMMAR.**

ParseIt is an interactive web application designed to help students and developers understand compiler theory through hands-on parsing of arithmetic expressions and regex patterns. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a visual and intuitive way to explore context-free grammar parsing with a combined grammar that supports both mathematical operations and regular expression constructs.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Expression Parser**: Input arithmetic expressions and regex patterns, see them parsed in real-time
- **Visual Parse Trees**: Watch as expressions are broken down into their grammatical components
- **Grammar Validation**: Confirm whether expressions follow proper context-free grammar rules
- **Educational Interface**: Clean, intuitive design that makes complex concepts accessible
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Animation**: Lenis (smooth scrolling)
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify ready
